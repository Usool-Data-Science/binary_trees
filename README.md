# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

Binary trees are foundational data structures extensively used in computer science and software engineering. They provide an efficient means of organizing and storing data, facilitating various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. Understanding the principles underlying binary trees is essential for mastering algorithm design, data structure optimization, and problem-solving in diverse domains. Each solution within this repository reflects a meticulous approach to binary tree management, adhering to industry best practices and coding standards. From creating nodes, traversing the tree, tp implementing specialized tree variants like binary search trees (BSTs) and AVL trees, the implementations here emphasize clarity, efficiency, and robustness. Summarily, this repo offers valuable insights into the intricacies of binary tree manipulation.

## System Requirements

Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or compatible Linux distribution
Compiler: gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) version 9.3.0 or later

## Data Structures

The project utilizes the following data structures and types for binary trees:

- Basic Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Max Binary Heap

## Compilation Process

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Usool-Data-Science/binary_trees.git
```

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current directory to the root folder of the cloned repository:

```
cd binary_trees
```

Compile the utility functions by running the following command:

```
make
```

This command will compile the utility functions and generate object files.

You can now compile and run individual test files from the `test` folder. For example, to compile and run `test/0-main.c`, use the following command:
make 0-main

Replace `0-main` with the appropriate test file name without the .c extension. This command will compile the specified test file and link it with the utility function object files to create the test executable.

You can also create test executables for all test files all at once by just running the command below without any arguments:

```
make
```

After testing, you can clean up generated files using the following command:

```
make clean
```
